=================

Mock EC2 metadata service that can run on a developer machine.

It is possible in AWS to protect [API access with
MFA](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html).
However, this is not convenient to setup or use since you must regularly refresh
your credentials.

Amazon EC2 instances have a metadata service that can be accessed to
retrieve the instance profile credentials. Those credentials are
rotated regularly and have an associated expiration. Most AWS SDKs
check this service to use the instance profile credentials.

This service runs on a developer machine and masquerades as the
Amazon metadata service. This allows it to integrate with the SDKs
and provide session credentials when needed. The credentials are generated
on demand using the STS GetSessionToken or AssumeRole API.

There are three effectives modes of operation for the service:

* If the user has no MFA device setup or MFA is disabled in configuration,
  the credentials are generated without a one time pass code. The resulting
  credentials should have the same permissions as the user's credentials.
  This operation is transparent to the user.
* If the user has a virtual MFA device and has provided the MFA secret,
  the pass code is generated by this service and used to create the 
  credentials. This operation is completely transparent to the user.
* If the user has an MFA device and has not provided the MFA secret,
  a small prompt window pops up to enter the OTP code when the service
  needs to generate new credentials. This will occur the first time
  the service starts up and after previous credentials expire. This
  mode can be useful if the user has a hardware keyfob, for testing
  the service with an existing virtual MFA, or if the user doesn't
  want to store the MFA secret.

# Dependencies

This application is still beta and may change in breaking ways in the
future.

* python 2
  * python 3 has not been tested
* boto python library
  * this may change to [botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore), which
    will impact config file format

# Installation

Currently only works on OSX, but should be trivial to make it work on
other platforms.

This should be changed to run as a launchd daemon at some point.

1. Clone the repo
2. Add AWS access key and secret key to *server.conf* in the repo
   directory
  * See Configuration section
  * These permanent keys are used to generate the session keys using the MFA token
  * There must be an MFA device associated with the account
3. Run `bin/server-macos`
  * Prompts for password to setup an IP alias and firewall forwarding rule.
  * You can examine the script and run the commands separately. The
    script is only provided for convenience.

mfa_secret=...   # Optional. Base32 encoded virtual MFA device secret.
                 # If set, the metadata server will generate OTP codes

## AWS CLI

If you don't provide the MFA secret and use a separate device to generate
OTP codes, it is recommended to update the local metadata service timeout
for the AWS command line interface. This ensures that you have enough time
to enter the MFA token before the request expires and your script can
continue without interruption.

*~/.aws/config*

```
[default]
metadata_service_timeout = 15.0  # 15 second timeout to enter MFA token
```

# Mock Endpoints

The following EC2 metadata service endpoints are implemented.

```
169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/local-credentials
```

If the MFA device secret is not provided and 
`/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/local-credentials` is
requested and there are no session credentials available, a dialog pops
up prompting for the MFA token. The dialog blocks the request until the
correct token is entered. Once the token is provided, the session
credentials are generated and cached until they expire. Once they
expire, a new token prompt will appear on the next request for
credentials.

# User Interface

A simple UI to view, reset, and update the session credentials is
available by loading *http://169.254.169.254/manage* in your
browser.

# API

There is an API available to query and update the MFA session
credentials.
